# Hi, I'm Simon! <br> Nice to meet you 👋

I am from Zürich and now based in Canberra. I grew up around making things, from woodworking and circuits to digital projects.

I spent ten years as a chef before moving into tech and government roles, then studied Software Engineering at the University of Canberra. I’m interested in software, cyber security, and building practical tools.

This site is where I keep projects and notes as I explore new things.
